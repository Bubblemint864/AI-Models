A simple repository where I upload models that I have trained and other related material!

|  Scale  |  Model Name  |  Architecture  |  Release  |
| -- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 2x | Bubble_AnimeScale_Compact_v1 | [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) Compact | [Link](https://github.com/Bubblemint864/AI-Models/releases/tag/2x_Bubble_AnimeScale_Compact_v1)
| 2x | Bubble_AnimeScale_SwinIR_Small_v1 | [SwinIR](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR) Small | [Link](https://github.com/Bubblemint864/AI-Models/releases/tag/2x_Bubble_AnimeScale_SwinIR_Small_v1)
## Using my models
All of my models (at least currently) are supported by [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer), an upscaling GUI that allows for both very simple and very complex tasks to be completed in a nice manner where you "chain" nodes together. Highly recommended for images.

If you're looking to upscale videos using my models then I would suggest using [enhancr](https://github.com/mafiosnik777/enhancr) simply due to the fact that it supports TensorRT - which will allow you to upscale videos at incredible speeds! The GUI is one of the best looking applications out there and is personally my go to option. While yes builds are paid, it is well worth your money and beats any other GUI out there currently. As of now SwinIR is not supported in enhancr, therefore only my Compact model will work with it.

For the command line warriors out there, [VSGAN-tensorrt-docker](https://github.com/styler00dollar/VSGAN-tensorrt-docker) achieves most of the things that you would want to do when it comes to upscaling videos, although not the most user friendly thing out there - it's still pretty good in my opinion!
